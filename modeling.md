# Data Modeling

* Duration:  8-hours/1 day
* Skill Level: Intermediate

## Course Description

This course teaches how to design and implement a graph data model and associated queries. With a mixture of instruction and hands-on practice sessions, you’ll learn how to apply the property graph model to solve common modeling problems. You’ll also learn how to evolve an existing graph in a controlled manner to support new or changed requirements. 

## Skills taught:

* An understanding of the labeled property graph
* How to apply the property graph to common modeling problems
* Common graph structures for modeling complex, connected scenarios
* Criteria for choosing between different modeling options
* How to modify an existing model to accommodate new requirements

## Prerequisites

You will need some familiarity with Cayley, and the it's query language in particular. The material from the Intro to Cayley course is sufficient knowledge to understand this course.

## Course Outline

* Introduction to Graphs
* Introduction to Graph based Modeling
* The Query language
* Advanced Queries
* Real-world implementation use cases with Cayley

## Technical requirements

*You will need your own laptop.*  Please arrive early to quickly install the product and labs used in the class.
